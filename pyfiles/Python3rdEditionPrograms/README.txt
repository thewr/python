This directory contains the programs used in the book "The Practice of
Computing Using Python", 3rd edition. The organization of this
directory is by chapter, where each chapter directory contains the
programs used in that chapter. The names of the files in each
directory contain the Listing number where they were used in the book.

These programs were created and run under Python version 3.4 and
should work under that version or any later version of Python, though
there are no guarantees as there are changes that occur as Python
develops.
